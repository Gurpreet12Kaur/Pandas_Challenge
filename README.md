As the newly appointed Chief Data Scientist for our local government, my primary responsibility is to aid the school board and mayor in making strategic decisions concerning school budgets and priorities.
My first task involves conducting an in-depth analysis of the area-wide standardized test results. 
With access to comprehensive data, including student math and reading scores and school-specific information, I will identify and highlight significant trends in school performance. 
By carefully examining this vast dataset, I aim to provide valuable insights to education policymakers and school administrators. 
This data-driven approach will help shape educational policies, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately enhance the overall quality of education in our community. 
My role as the Chief Data Scientist holds the key to empowering local leaders to make informed decisions, improve student outcomes, and create a promising future for our schools. I am committed to contributing my expertise and diligence to drive positive change and achieve a meaningful impact in our educational landscape.
I have done the best I could, I couldn't finish the assessment as I wasn't too sure, the parts I didn't were:
  Scores by School Spending
  Scores by School Size
  Scores by School Type
I also got help from the BSC, whoever helped me did a really good job. after I received there help I did always go back over the code to make sure i understand it.

REPORT


Summarises the analysis (5 points)

School Performance by Year Level: 
Across all year levels, Bailey High School frequently surpasses other schools in math. 
Math test results at Holden High School show a considerable increase from Year 9 to Year 10.

Reading Scores by School and Year Level.
Shelton High School typically has good reading scores across all year levels. 
 Reading test results at Pena High School significantly improved from Year 9 to Year 10.
 
Overall Passing Rates:
In schools with fewer students, the overall passing rate is higher. Schools with smaller class sizes and lower spending per student typically have greater overall passing rates.


Draws two correct conclusions

1. School Spending Impact: The investigation shows that the amount of money spent on education for each student has a major impact on how well students do.
Average math and reading test scores as well as overall passing rates tend to be higher in schools with lower per-student spending. This conclusion implies that improved academic results may result from focused expenditures in student learning and effective resource allocation.

2. School Size and Student Success: The analysis suggests that school size also affects student achievement. In both math and reading results, smaller schools typically beat medium and big schools. In smaller schools, the overall passing rates are also higher. This shows that smaller educational institutions could offer a more favorable learning environment and individualized care, which would boost student performance.
